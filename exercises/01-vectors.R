# Subsetting an atomic vector
(x <- seq(from = 1, to = 10))

## Keep the first through fourth elements, plus the seventh element


## Keep the first through eighth elements, plus the tenth element


## Keep all elements with values greater than five


## Keep all elements evenly divisible by three


# Subsetting a list
(y <- list(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5)))

## Subset `a`. The result should be an atomic vector


## Subset `pi`. The results should be a new list


## Subset the first and third elements from `y`
