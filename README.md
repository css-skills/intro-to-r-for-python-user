## Overview

Python and R are two of the dominant programming languages used in data science. Python has strong demand within industry, while in many academic fields R is the preferred language. While the flame wars between Python and R users continue to rage, many leading software developers and data science practitioners urge users to learn how to leverage both languages depending on each software's natural strengths.^[Consider this illuminating interview with [Hadley Wickham](https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast/hadley-wickham-talks-integration-and-future-of-python-and-r), Chief Scientist at RStudio and an Adjunct Professor of Statistics at the University of Auckland, Stanford University, and Rice University.] This workshop is designed for Python users who want to learn how to use R in their work.

## Objectives

- Review the origins of the R programming language.
- Identify the basic elements of R
- Distinguish equivalent operations in R from Python
- Introduce a common set of packages for data analysis in R

## Audience

This workshop is designed for individuals with intermediate-to-advanced training and/or experience in Python (e.g. MACS 30121 and beyond) who have never used R before. Especially useful if you are taking a course which requires you to complete assignments using R.

## Location

Room 295 in [1155 E 60th St](https://goo.gl/maps/7n7wDsd9mjnfRBtR8).
